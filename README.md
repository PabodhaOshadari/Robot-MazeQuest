# Robot-MazeQuest
This repository contains the implementation of my 4th-year project related to Robotics and Intelligent Systems during my undergraduate degree.The project involves programming a robot to perform a series of autonomous tasks, including maze navigation, slit detection, and trajectory following.
Key Tasks:

    Maze Navigation:
        The robot autonomously navigates a maze and identifies the exit. Performance is evaluated based on the completion time, with the maze potentially varying during the final demonstration.

    Slit Detection:
        Upon exiting the maze, the robot encounters a wall with randomly open or closed slits. It identifies the number of open slits while navigating along the wall.

    Path Selection:
        At the end of the wall, the robot selects one of three paths based on the number of detected open slits. It follows the pre-programmed trajectory corresponding to the slit count and stops within a designated parking zone.

A map is included to illustrate the maze structure and the robotâ€™s path, providing a clear visualization of the navigation and task execution.
