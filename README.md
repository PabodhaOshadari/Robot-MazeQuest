# Robot-MazeQuest
The project involves programming a robot to autonomously navigate a maze, detect specific environmental conditions, and make decisions based on sensory input. The robot must first find the exit of a maze, adjusting to slight variations in the final design, with performance evaluated on completion time. After exiting, it encounters a straight wall with randomly open or closed slits; the robot needs to count these slits while navigating forward. Based on the detected number of open slits, the robot selects one of three predefined, unmarked paths and follows the corresponding trajectory to a marked parking zone, completing the task.
